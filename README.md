This repository contains the automation projects I worked on at the Boston Water and Sewer Commission. For the Python projects, I used the ArcPy library to convert geoprocessing tasks into Python code, which created reusable scripts for future use.

**StormwaterParcels** was a small project that identified land parcels with building footprints to be used for stormwater billing.

**UpdateLocator** was the largest automation project I worked on, it converted 12 pages of manual steps to update BWSC's internal locator tool into one, reusable Python script.
 
**LeadServiceModel** is a ModelBuilder automation that located and labeled lead water service pipes in Boston with a point layer. The document **LeadModelSteps** provides step by step instructions on how I created the model and how it can be replicated.
