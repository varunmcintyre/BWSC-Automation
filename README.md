This repository contains the two Python automation projects I worked on at the Boston Water and Sewer Commission. I used the ArcPy library to convert geoprocessing tasks into single lines of Python code, which creates a reusable script for future use.

The StormwaterParcels project was a small project that identified land parcels with building footprints to be used for stormwater billing.

The UpdateLocator project was the largest automation project I worked on, it converted 12 pages of manual steps to update BWSC's internal locator tool into one, reusable Python script.
 
This repository does not include my automation project with ModelBuilder, which located and labeled lead pipes in Boston.
